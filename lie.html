  <h3>March 27, 11:00-12:00</h3>

  <p><strong>Title:</strong> Extended duality and unipotent representations</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Unipotent representations are believed to be the building blocks of unitary dual of semisimple/reductive Lie groups. In their study of special unipotent representations for complex semisimple groups, Barbasch and Vogan constructed a duality map between the nilpotent orbits of G and that of its Langlands dual group G<sup>v</sup> (also discovered by Lusztig and Spaltenstein), which allows them to describe the unipotent ideals and representations of G in terms of G<sup>v</sup>. Later Sommers and Achar extended this duality map by considering pairs (O, C) consisting of a nilpotent orbit O and a conjugacy class C in its Lusztig canonical quotient group.</p>
  <p>In the joint work with Lucas Mason-Brown and Dmytro Matvieievskyi (arXiv:2309.14853), we have extended the Sommers' duality map in another direction by considering covers of nilpotent orbits, which turns out to be equivalent to Achar's duality map (in a nontrivial way). This extended duality map allows us to describe the (generalized) unipotent ideals and bimodules attached to nilpotent covers, proposed previously by Ivan Losev and my other two coauthors, in terms of the Langlands dual group.</p>

  <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Soo Teck Lee (National University of Singapore)</p>
  <p><strong>Title:</strong> Pieri rule and highest weight modules of the general linear algebras</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Pieri rule for GL<sub>n</sub> = GL<sub>n</sub>(C) is one of the best known results on tensor product of representations. It describes the irreducible decomposition of V ⊗ S<sup>k</sup>(C<sup>n</sup>) where V is an irreducible polynomial representation of GL<sub>n</sub> and V ⊗ S<sup>k</sup>(C<sup>n</sup>) is a symmetric power of the standard representation on C<sup>n</sup>. In this talk, we will explain how to use the Pieri rule to obtain weight multiplicities and bases of some highest weight modules of the general linear algebra.</p>
  
  <h3>April 10, 11:00-12:00</h3>
  <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Pavle Pandzic (University of Zagreb)</p>
  <p><strong>Title:</strong> Clifford algebras, symmetric spaces and cohomology rings of Grassmannians</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study various kinds of Grassmannians or Lagrangian Grassmannians over <b>R</b>,<b> C</b> or <b>H</b>, all of which can be expressed as <b>G/P</b> where <b>G</b> is a classical group and <b>P</b> is a parabolic subgroup of <b>G</b> with abelian unipotent radical. The same Grassmannians can also be realized as (classical) compact symmetric spaces G/K. We give explicit generators and relations for the de Rham cohomology rings of <b>G/P</b>=G/K. At the same time we describe certain filtered deformations of these rings, related to Clifford algebras and spin modules. While the cohomology rings are of our primary interest, the filtered setting of K-invariants in the Clifford algebra actually provides a more conceptual framework for the results we obtain. This is joint work with Kieran Calvert and Kyo Nishiyama.
